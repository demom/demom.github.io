<p>Hi and welcome to my Github page. This is some sort of devlog, an outlet for my thinkings, raging and discoveries regarding programming in Swift and related subjects.</p>
<p>This devlog is written in markdown with iA Writer on both iOS and Mac, using Dropbox as storage. As a publishing tool I’ve written a small Swift program that manages both markdown-to-html conversation with templates and such, as well as committing and pushing it to <a target=_blank href="https://github.com/demom/demom.github.io">Github</a>. It’s sort of like Jekyll, only smaller and more adapted to my specific needs.</p>
<p>Who I am? If you are, for reasons unknown, interested in finding out, you can read more about me <a target=_blank href="https://demom.github.io">here</a>.</p>
<p>Why <a target=_blank href="https://github.com/demom">Github</a>? Thats a very good question, and the answer is not that crystal clear. A professional developer in the realms of PHP, Python and Microsoft .NET, I’m starting dabbling around with Swift. And since Swift is both open-source and quite new, I thought that I’d follow the lead and publish all of my own code as open source. And where is better for doing that then <a target=_blank href="https://github.com/demom">Github</a>?</p>
<p>So, once again, welcome to my <a target=_blank href="https://demom.github.io">Github page</a>.</p>
