# About me

I’m a Swedish middle-age guy named Tommy. My interest in computers started with a Macintosh SE somewhere around 1989 or so, and my first brushes with programming was using Hypercard on that very machine.

Since the power supply on the Mac went kaputt I made due with a range of Windows machines, from 3.10 up to Windows 10 today. And while introduced in 1999 it took a couple more years until Linux and GNOME became my desktop of choice - started at Slackware and ended up  with Ubuntu.

A few years back, I got my hands on a Macbook Pro at work, and now I’m once again a loyal Apple user both in my profession as well as privately (although I’m running Windows 10 as a VM for those few tasks, and a couple of Ubuntu servers is still humming along in my basement, to power my hobbies).

My day job is as an IT consultant and software developer at Maintrac AB, a swedish system integrator and consultant firm specializing in tele communications and IT. I mostly work with Microsoft .NET platform, PHP and a lot of SQL, but during those long nights I like trying out new (and old) things in a wide range of hobby projects, for example writing programs in Apples new programming language Swift, or web services and scripts in Python (version 3 of course, everything before it is dead in my eyes). My latest fad is the nosql database RethinkDB.

What about my family, you ask? Well, over the years I’ve managed to collect the complete set - a wife, one daughter and one son, a house, car and a dog.

The time not allocated to sleeping, work, hobbies or family (not necessarily in that order) I usually spend walking the dog, doing some well-needed fixing up on our mid-20-century brick house or perhaps playing a game on my treasured Playstation 4.

If you, for whatever reason unbeknown to me, still want to reach me, you can find be at Twitter or perhaps browse my repos on Github.
