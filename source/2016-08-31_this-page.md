# This page

So, about this page. It basically very simple, with an index page, a couple fo resources (css, js) and a source library of Markdown documents.

To describe it in a bit more complex form: it's a Javascript blog frontend with a static file database as a backend. All logic are executed on the client using Javascript, and the server is only used to serve static pages.

The excellent Markdown to HTML javascript library Showdown is used to render the Markdown files, also done on the client.

The Markdown files are written using either the really great iA Writer or whatever dev editor I'm using at the time (VS Code, Sublime Text, TextMate, Nano and so on), an index file is updated with the new entry and the whole shebang is then pushed to Github and published.

It cant be more simple than that.
