# First post

Hi and welcome to my Github page. This is some sort of devlog, an outlet for my thinkings, raging and discoveries regarding programming in Python, Swift and related subjects.

Why using [Github](https://github.com/demom)? Thats a very good question, and the answer is not that crystal clear. As a long time Linux user Iâ€™ve always been a proponent of the Open Source world and community. So not publishing my own hobby coding as Open Source would be very hypocritical of me and an insult to the Great God That Is Linus Torvalds (not that he cares, but still). And what better place than [Github](https://github.com/demom)?

And honoring that spirit, this devlog is hosted on Github Pages, but more on that in a [newer post](?2016-08-31_this-page.md).

At last, you ask who I am? If you are, for reasons unknown, interested in finding out, you can read more [about me here](?about_me.md).

So, once again, welcome to my [Github page](https://demom.github.io).
