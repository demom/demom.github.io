# First post

Hi and welcome to my Github page. This is some sort of devlog, an outlet for my thinkings, raging and discoveries regarding programming in Swift and related subjects.

This devlog is written in markdown with iA Writer on both iOS and Mac, using Dropbox as storage. As a publishing tool I’ve written a small Swift program that manages both markdown-to-html conversation with templates and such, as well as committing and pushing it to [Github](https://github.com/demom/demom.github.io). It’s sort of like Jekyll, only smaller and more adapted to my specific needs.

Who I am? If you are, for reasons unknown, interested in finding out, you can read more about me [here](/about-me.html).

Why [Github](https://github.com/demom)? Thats a very good question, and the answer is not that crystal clear. A professional developer in the realms of PHP, Python and Microsoft .NET, I’m starting dabbling around with Swift. And since Swift is both open-source and quite new, I thought that I’d follow the lead and publish all of my own code as open source. And where is better for doing that then [Github](https://github.com/demom)?

So, once again, welcome to my [Github page](https://demom.github.io).
