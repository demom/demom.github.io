# First post

Hi and welcome to my Github page. This is some sort of devlog, an outlet for my thinkings, raging and discoveries regarding programming in Swift and related subjects.

This devlog is written in markdown with iA Writer on my Macbook Pro and published via - you guessed it, Git of course. It uses Showdown Markdown to HTML converter to make it look all pretty and so. Very simple, very static.

Who I am? If you are, for reasons unknown, interested in finding out, you can read more about me [here](/?about-me.html).

Why [Github](https://github.com/demom)? Thats a very good question, and the answer is not that crystal clear. A professional developer in the realms of PHP, Python and Microsoft .NET as well as Apples new Swift language - and a multi-decade Linux user at that - Iâ€™ve always been a proponent of the Open Source world and community. So not publishing my own hobby coding as Open Source would be very hypocritical of me. And what better place than [Github](https://github.com/demom)?

So, once again, welcome to my [Github page](https://demom.github.io).
