					<h1>About me</h1>
				</header>
				<p>
					So, I'm a swedish middle-age guy named Tommy. I've got a family of four (the complete set - wife, daughter and a son), a house, car and a dog. The whole shebang.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm a professional software developer and IT consultant, working for a swedish consultant company specializing in tue automation of network provisioning and monitoring. Very exciting work, having watched and in a small way helped broadband Sweden grow for the last decade.
				</p>
				<p>
					While I'm not tending to the kids, or trying to do some work on our mid-century house, I usually do my coding in Microsoft .NET, PHP and Python. And at the same time I', always on the lookout for new and exciting things to try. In the basement I'm in the process of setting up a redundant and load-balancing processing cluster based on a home-built server and Raspberry PI 2 nodes.
				</p>
				<h2>Swift</h2>
				<p>Recently I started dabbling around with Apples open-source programming language Swift. Started by porting a Mono/.NET program to it (basically a nice front-end for the Unison file synchronizer, with some added functionalities), and shortly thereafter began rewriting my Python server scripts.
